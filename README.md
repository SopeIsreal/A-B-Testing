# A-B-Testing
A/B testing is also known as split testing and in simple terms, it means when two or more versions of a variable e.g a web page or a web feature, are used on different website visitors to determine which version has the best impact and drives sales/business metrics.
A/B testing is important for website optimization because it eliminates guesswork and enables one to make data backed decisions. In A/B testing, ‘A’ refers to the original version or the ‘control version’ while ‘B’ refers to the new version or the ‘variation’ of the original test variable.	
	This project attempts to analyze two datasets containing data from an original version and a variation of a website's marketing strategy/campaign. The best version is the version that moves the business metrics forward in the best direction and is also known as the ‘winner’.
